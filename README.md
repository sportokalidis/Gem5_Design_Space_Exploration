### _2. Design Exploration_

In this part of exercise , we will try to choose the suitable parameters in order to succeed a better performance for our system, for each benchmark: <br/>

***Average memory access time = Hit time + Miss rate Ã— Miss penalty*** <br/>

**Reducing the miss rate**: larger block size, larger cache size, and higher associativity.
**Reducing the miss penalty**: multilevel caches.


The classical approach to improving cache behavior is to reduce miss rates. To gain better insights into the causes of misses, we first start with a model that sorts all misses into three simple categories:<br/><br/>

**Compulsory misses**: The very first access to a block cannot be in the cache, so the
block must be brought into the cache. These are also called cold-start misses
or first-reference misses.<br/>
**Capacity misses**: If the cache cannot contain all the blocks needed during execution
of a program, capacity misses (in addition to compulsory misses) will occur
because of blocks being discarded and later retrieved.<br/>
**Conflict misses**: If the block placement strategy is set associative or direct mapped,
conflict misses (in addition to compulsory and capacity misses) will occur
because a block may be discarded and later retrieved if too many blocks map
to its set. These misses are also called collision misses. The idea is that hits in
a fully associative cache that become misses in an n-way set-associative
cache are due to more than n requests on some popular sets.<br/>

* **Increase Block size**
  + Reduces compulsory misses
  + Increases capacity and conflict misses, increases miss penalty

* **Increase capacity of the cache**
  + Increases hit time, increases power consumption

* **Higher associativity**
  + Reduces conflict misses
  + Increases hit time, increases power consumption

* **Higher number of cache levels**
  + Reduces overall memory access time
